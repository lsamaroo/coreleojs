## CORELEO Library 
This library contains a set of utilities for working with strings, array, objects, etc. as well with JQuery UI and JQuery Mobile.
It incorporates fixes to UI items (such as making Select2 displayed correctly in JQuery dialog) which have not made it into the standard API for various reasons.
It also attempts to be transparent between desktop and mobile browsers and automatically handle UI usability and design issues between the two.  
For example calling dialog.open on a browser will display a dialog but in mobile browser it displays a much more usable side panel.
